# DataOverviewer
A vizualization extension for Qlik Sense

Data Overviewer gives the user a helicopter view of all data.
It vizualises all fields in the app through an interactive grid of charts.

It orders the data out of the box by placing all fields with numerical values on the
Y axis and the remaining fields as dimensions on the X axis.

The grid behaves as a map when it comes to interaction by allowing the user to pan
and zoom to discover more data.

The charts show data with different granularity depending on zoom level.

It's possible to switch between bar chart and line chart representation for now.
